                <figcaption>Naruto</figcaption>
                <p>I followed this anime for the longest time. I started watching it when I was 9, and continued until it ended when I turned 18. It holds a deep sense of nostalgia for me. What kept me invested throughout the years wasn't just the memories, but the plot and the development of the characters. From laughter to heart-wrenching moments, thrilling action to a sprinkle of romance—this anime has it all. I would love to relive that experience and watch it for the first time again.</p>

                <figcaption>Hunter x Hunter</figcaption>
                <p>Hunter x Hunter was recommended to me by my brother. At first, I was hesitant because the art style seemed too childish, but I ended up binge-watching all 148 episodes in just a few weeks. This series is a wild ride and an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. The journey is both thrilling and heartbreaking. It's definitely one of those shows I'd love to watch again for the first time. Warning: some arcs get really dark, so be prepared!</p>

                <figcaption>Mobile Suite Gundam SEED</figcaption>
                <p>This one's a childhood favorite that I ended up loving even more when I watched it as an adult. Just like any meccha anime, this isn't just about fighting robots. Gundam SEED delves deep into the ethics of genetic engineering and the battle between two opposing moral philosophies. It's a thought-provoking experience, and I do wish there was at least one more season!</p>

                <figcaption>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</figcaption>
                <p>A truly bizarre adventure. I watched this series during the lockdown, and it quickly became a comfort watch for me. Although, I use the term "comfort" lightly, Jojo's is an emotional rollercoaster, especially Stardust Crusaders (my personal favorite). It's outrageous, campy, and filled with unforgettable characters that you can't help but fall in love with. It's a series you won't forget.</p>

                <figcaption>Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood</figcaption>
                <p>To clarify: I'm referring to Brotherhood, as it follows the manga much more accurately than the original Fullmetal Alchemist. While the original holds a nostalgic place in my heart for disturbing me as a child, Brotherhood introduces all the amazing characters that the original didn't.</p>

                <figcaption>Haikyuu!!</figcaption>
                <p>Even if you're not typically into sports anime, Haikyuu!! is definitely worth watching, especially if you enjoy a good underdog story. The beginning is a little slow, but once it picks up, you’ll find yourself binge-watching the entire series, just like I did. It was recommended to me by my brothers, and although I almost dropped it early on, I can tell you now that you'll regret not sticking with it!</p>

        <h2 id="video-text">Favourite Opening Song</h2>
        <p>This is my all-time favorite anime opening. A couple of years ago, I attended a Candlelight Concert with the theme "Favorite Anime Themes," and it was an unforgettable experience. The songs brought back so many nostalgic memories that I was almost brought to tears. But when "Blue Bird" by Ikimono Gakari started playing, my friends and nearly screamed and jumped out of our seats in pure joy.</p>
